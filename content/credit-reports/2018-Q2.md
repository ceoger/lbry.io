## Summary
This quarter we moved no credits from cold storage.  We spent 682,027 total community credits on line items detailed below. No operational credits were moved to markets. No institutional credits were moved or spent.
We anticipate comparable or larger total outlays in Q3 2018. Operational spending may increase, but not significantly, and community spending is likely to be higher. We will continue to incentivize new users and other beneficial behavior, which is likely to involve 300,000 to 1,500,000+ LBC. LBRY is also likely to form itâ€™s first institutional partnership, with spending anticipated to be around 500,000 LBC.

## Overview By Fund

### Community Fund

682,027 credits were spent from the community fund, in the following areas:

| Category | Amount |

### Operational Fund

* LBRY sold no LBC on the open market

LBRY does not anticipate moving credits to market this quarter due to both market conditions and our favorable cash position. However, should market conditions or our needs change, we reserve the right to move credits to market as needed.


### Institutional Fund

No activity this quarter.

We may run our first institutional pilot programs this quarter. Any outlays from this fund this quarter will be minimal.
