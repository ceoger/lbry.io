title: How do tipping and supporting in LBRY work?
category: getstarted
---

LBRY allows you to tip and support your favorite creators.

Tips can also be sent via the LBRY app or via the protocol's [`support_create`](/api#support_create) command (with an associated claim id and `--tip` parameter). If sent without the `--tip` parameter, this is considered a support that can be redeemed by the person who made it at any time (think of it as a self tip, but helping someone else's content).

These credits are automatically stored as associated with the content owners' claim, which helps the claim perform better in search results, top, and [trending calculations](https://lbry.com/faq/trending). It also helps secure the winning [vanity name claims](/faq/naming).

Version 0.34 of the Desktop application also has a experimental setting for supporting claims without tipping. This means you help the publisher rank up their content, but you can redeem your deposit at anytime. [Learn more below](#supports)

### How do I send a tip?

Sending tips via the LBRY app is easy. Simply go to the page of the content you want to support and click "Send a tip".

Next, you'll be prompted for the tip amount in LBRY Credits (LBC). Once you enter a value, click "Send". Mahalo!

**Note: This amount will show up in your transaction list and will be deducted from your balance.**

### How do I redeem my tips?

When you receive a tip, the credits will come into your wallet, and you can see them in your Transaction History. However, since the credits come in as supporting a claim, they will not show in your available balance.

To have these credits show in your balance, they must be unlocked via the wallet Overview/History page. This is done by clicking the unlock icon next to `Tip` and then confirming your action on the following screen. Once the transaction is finalized, the icon will disappear. This also nullifies any help the support/tip was giving in terms of search results, trending, and top discovery mechanisms.

### How do I send a support? {#supports}

Enable this option on the Settings page (Experimental Options) of the LBRY Desktop app. Then navigate to a page you want to help and click the support button.
